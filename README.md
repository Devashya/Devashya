## Hi, I’m Devashya 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with a strong interest in **applied AI and backend systems**, focused on building practical, reliable products using **LLMs, retrieval-based systems (RAG), and scalable APIs**.

I enjoy taking ideas from concept to production — thinking through system design, performance, and real-world usability rather than just demos.

### 💻 What I work on
- Building **LLM-powered applications** with a focus on accuracy, grounding, and reliability  
- Designing **backend services and APIs** using Python and FastAPI  
- Working with **RAG pipelines**, embeddings, and vector databases (FAISS)  
- Turning complex data and workflows into usable, customer-facing features  

### 🚀 Notable Projects
- **AI Resume Analyzer & Interview Prep Tool**  
  An LLM-based system that analyzes resumes and generates personalized interview questions using retrieval-based techniques.

- **MedAI Navigator**  
  A RAG-based medical assistant that grounds LLM responses in medical reports using embeddings and vector search to reduce hallucinations.

### 🛠 Tech I use regularly
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL  
- **AI / ML:** LLMs, RAG, Hugging Face, LangChain, FAISS, Prompt Engineering  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs, Async processing  
- **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, S3, IAM, CloudWatch)  

### 🎯 What I care about
- Building things that are **useful, not just impressive**
- Writing code that’s **clear, maintainable, and production-ready**
- Learning fast by shipping, measuring, and iterating

📫 Feel free to check out my repositories or reach out — I’m always happy to talk about AI systems, backend design, or interesting problems.
